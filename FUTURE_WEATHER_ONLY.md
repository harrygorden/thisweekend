# Future-Only Weather Display

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Type:** UX Enhancement  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Problem Identified

Weather display showed **historical data** along with future forecasts, creating misleading information for users.

### User Report

Looking at the screenshot at 3 PM on Saturday:

```
Saturday Card:
  Afternoon: 59¬∞F, 0% rain
  Evening: 58¬∞F, 0% rain
  
Bottom of card: "üíß 100% rain" in red

Sunday Card:
  Morning: 46¬∞F, 80% rain
  Afternoon: 47¬∞F, 25% rain
  Evening: 52¬∞F, 0% rain
  
Bottom of card: "üíß 100% rain" in red
```

**User's Question:** "Why does it show 100% rain when the only remaining time periods are 0%?"

**Answer:** The system was showing the MAX rain chance from ALL periods (including past morning rain), not just future periods.

---

## The Core Issue

### What Was Wrong

Users don't care about **historical weather** - they care about **what's coming**.

```
Scenario: It's 3 PM on Saturday

Morning (6 AM - 12 PM): 100% rain ‚Üê ALREADY HAPPENED
Afternoon (12 PM - 6 PM): 0% rain ‚Üê CURRENT/FUTURE
Evening (6 PM - 12 AM): 0% rain ‚Üê FUTURE

OLD Display: "100% rain" ‚ùå
- Based on ALL periods including past
- Suggests outdoor events are bad
- Discourages users from going out

NEW Display: "0% rain" ‚úÖ  
- Based only on FUTURE periods
- Suggests outdoor events are great
- Accurately reflects what's ahead
```

### Impact on User Decisions

**OLD System:**
```
3 PM: User checks app
Sees: "100% rain"
Thinks: "Better stay inside"
Reality: Beautiful clear afternoon & evening ahead!
Result: Missed opportunities ‚ùå
```

**NEW System:**
```
3 PM: User checks app
Sees: "0% rain for afternoon & evening"
Thinks: "Great time to go out!"
Reality: Matches the forecast!
Result: Accurate planning ‚úÖ
```

## The Solution

### 1. Time-Aware Filtering

Added logic to detect current time in Central timezone and filter periods:

```python
# Get current time
now_central = datetime.now(central_tz)
current_hour = now_central.hour
today = now_central.date()

# Filter based on time of day
if is_today:
    if current_hour >= 18:  # 6 PM+
        # Only show evening
        morning = None
        afternoon = None
    elif current_hour >= 12:  # 12 PM+
        # Only show afternoon & evening
        morning = None
    else:
        # Morning - show all periods
        pass
```

### 2. Future-Only Calculations

Recalculate all metrics from future periods only:

```python
# Collect future periods
future_periods = []
if morning:
    future_periods.append(morning)
if afternoon:
    future_periods.append(afternoon)
if evening:
    future_periods.append(evening)

# Calculate from FUTURE only
future_precip_chances = [p.get("precipitation_chance", 0) for p in future_periods]
actual_precip_chance = max(future_precip_chances)
```

### 3. UI Updates

Show appropriate messages based on what's left:

```python
if period_lines:
    # Show future periods
    display_periods(period_lines)
elif is_today and not period_lines:
    # All periods passed
    show_message("üìÖ Rest of day looks clear")
```

## Before vs After

### Scenario 1: Morning Rain, Clear Afternoon

**Time:** 2 PM on Saturday  
**Actual Weather:**
- Morning: 100% rain (passed)
- Afternoon: 0% rain (current)
- Evening: 0% rain (future)

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Display** | 100% rain | 0% rain |
| **Periods Shown** | All 3 | Afternoon + Evening only |
| **Outdoor Score** | Poor (due to "rain") | Excellent (clear ahead!) |
| **User Action** | Stays inside ‚ùå | Goes out ‚úÖ |

### Scenario 2: Early Morning

**Time:** 8 AM on Saturday  
**Actual Weather:**
- Morning: 20% rain (current)
- Afternoon: 50% rain (future)
- Evening: 10% rain (future)

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Display** | 50% rain | 50% rain |
| **Periods Shown** | All 3 | All 3 |
| **Outdoor Score** | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Result** | Same (correct - all periods ahead) ‚úÖ |

### Scenario 3: Late Evening

**Time:** 9 PM on Saturday  
**Actual Weather:**
- Morning: 80% rain (passed)
- Afternoon: 60% rain (passed)
- Evening: 5% rain (current)

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Display** | 80% rain | 5% rain |
| **Periods Shown** | All 3 | Evening only |
| **Outdoor Score** | Poor | Great |
| **User Action** | Misses evening events ‚ùå | Can still go out ‚úÖ |

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side (`weather_service.py`)

**New Function Logic:**

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def get_weather_data():
    """
    Returns weather forecasts with future-only filtering.
    """
    # 1. Get current time in Central timezone
    # 2. For each forecast day:
    #    - Extract all time periods
    #    - If today: filter out past periods
    #    - If future day: keep all periods
    # 3. Calculate metrics from future periods only:
    #    - precipitation_chance = max of future periods
    #    - conditions = most common in future periods
    # 4. Return filtered data
```

**Time Period Logic:**
- Morning: 6 AM - 12 PM (noon)
- Afternoon: 12 PM - 6 PM
- Evening: 6 PM - 12 AM (midnight)

**Filtering Rules:**
```python
Current Time    | Periods Shown
----------------|------------------
6 AM - 11:59 AM | Morning, Afternoon, Evening
12 PM - 5:59 PM | Afternoon, Evening
6 PM - 11:59 PM | Evening
After midnight  | (next day)
```

### Client-Side (`WeatherCard`)

**Enhanced Display:**

```python
def display_time_periods(self, weather):
    # Build period lines from non-None periods
    # If no periods but is_today:
    #   Show "Rest of day looks clear"
    # Else:
    #   Show available future periods
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Day Transition at Midnight
```
11:59 PM: Shows current day's evening period
12:00 AM: Shows next day's all periods
```

### 2. No Future Periods Remaining
```
10 PM: Only evening period shown
11 PM: Evening period shown
11:59 PM: Evening period shown
12:00 AM: Switches to next day
```

### 3. Future Days (Tomorrow, Day After)
```
Always show all three periods since entire day is in future
No filtering needed
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Better Event Recommendations

**Scenario:** Saturday 2 PM, outdoor concert at 7 PM

**Before:**
```
Weather: "100% rain" (from morning)
Recommendation: Poor weather score
User: Skips the concert
Reality: Evening was perfect ‚ùå
```

**After:**
```
Weather: "0% rain" (afternoon/evening only)
Recommendation: Excellent weather score
User: Attends the concert
Reality: Perfect match ‚úÖ
```

### Accurate Planning

Users can now:
- ‚úÖ See what weather is **actually coming**
- ‚úÖ Make decisions based on **future conditions**
- ‚úÖ Not be misled by **past weather**
- ‚úÖ Get accurate **outdoor event recommendations**
