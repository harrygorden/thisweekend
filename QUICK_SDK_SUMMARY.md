# Quick SDK Setup Summary

## TL;DR - What Changed?

Your `requirements.txt` was all commented out. I've updated the code to:

✅ **Use Firecrawl Python SDK** (instead of raw HTTP)  
✅ **Use OpenAI Python SDK** (instead of raw HTTP)  
✅ **Automatic fallback** to HTTP if SDKs not available  
✅ **Updated `requirements.txt`** with proper dependencies  

---

## The Problem You Noticed

```python
# ❌ OLD: Everything commented out
# # This Weekend - Server Code Dependencies
# # 
# # External API integrations (accessed via anvil.http):
# # - Firecrawl API
# # - OpenAI API
```

This meant you were using **raw HTTP requests** instead of the official SDKs.

---

## The Solution

```python
# ✅ NEW: Real dependencies
firecrawl-py>=1.0.0        # Firecrawl Python SDK (more reliable)
openai>=1.0.0              # OpenAI Python SDK
anvil-uplink               # For local development
```

Plus the code now **tries SDK first**, **falls back to HTTP** if needed.

---

## How to Use the SDKs (3 Options)

### Option 1: Local Development with Anvil Uplink ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```bash
# Install packages locally
pip install -r server_code/requirements.txt

# Run Anvil Uplink (get URL from Anvil Settings → Uplink)
python -m anvil.uplink --server-url wss://anvil.works/uplink/YOUR-KEY
```

**Result:** Full SDK support, instant code updates! 🚀

---

### Option 2: Request Packages in Anvil (Production)

1. In Anvil: **Settings** → **Dependencies**
2. Request: `firecrawl-py` and `openai`
3. Wait for approval (1-3 days)

**Result:** Production-ready with full SDK support! 🎯

---

### Option 3: Do Nothing (Works Now!)

Your code **already has HTTP fallback**, so:
- No action needed
- Less reliable than SDKs
- Still functional

**Result:** Works immediately, less robust. ⚠️

---

## What You'll See

### With SDKs Installed:
```
✅ Firecrawl Python SDK available - using SDK mode
✅ OpenAI Python SDK available - using SDK mode
  🚀 Using Firecrawl Python SDK (recommended)
  ✅ SDK scrape successful: 15234 characters
```

### Without SDKs (Fallback):
```
⚠️ Firecrawl SDK not installed - using fallback HTTP mode
⚠️ OpenAI SDK not installed - using fallback HTTP mode
  📡 Using raw HTTP method (fallback)
  Received 15234 bytes
```

## Why SDKs Are Better

| Feature | SDK | Raw HTTP |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Error handling | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual |
| Type safety | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Retries | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Manual |
| Updates | ✅ Auto | ❌ Manual |
| Rate limiting | ✅ Handled | ❌ Manual |

**Bottom line:** SDKs = More reliable, easier to maintain! 📈

## Files Changed

1. **`server_code/requirements.txt`** - Uncommented and documented
2. **`server_code/scraper_service.py`** - Added SDK support with fallback
3. **`server_code/ai_service.py`** - Added SDK support with fallback
4. **`SDK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Complete guide (this file's big brother)

---

## Quick Start

**For development (best experience):**
```bash
pip install -r server_code/requirements.txt
python -m anvil.uplink --server-url YOUR-UPLINK-URL
```

**For quick testing (no setup):**
- Just run in Anvil - HTTP fallback works now!

**For production:**
- Request packages in Anvil Settings → Dependencies
