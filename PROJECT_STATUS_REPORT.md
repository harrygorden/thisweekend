## ⚠️ Current Issue (Minor Blocker)

### Firecrawl API - HTTP 400 Error

**Status:** In progress  
**Severity:** Medium (workaround available)  
**Impact:** Can't scrape real events from website

**Error:**
```
HTTP error 400 - Bad Request
```

**Likely Causes:**
1. API payload format changed in v1
2. API key needs permissions
3. URL requires special handling
4. Rate limit hit

**Workarounds Available:**
1. ✅ Use test events (14 realistic events ready)
2. ✅ Debug Firecrawl API (updated payload ready to test)
3. ✅ Build direct scraper (I can create if needed)

---

## 🎯 Three Paths Forward

### Path A: Use Test Events (FASTEST - 5 minutes)

**Best for:** Seeing app work immediately, testing UI

**Steps:**
1. Create `hourly_weather` table in Anvil
2. Push code, pull in Anvil
3. Run "Setup Database"
4. Add "Load Test Events" button to AdminForm
5. Click it!

**Result:**
- ✅ 14 events with weather scores
- ✅ Complete UI testable
- ✅ All features working
- ⏱️ Takes 5 minutes total

### Path B: Fix Firecrawl API (MEDIUM - 15-30 minutes)

**Best for:** Getting real Memphis events

**Steps:**
1. Check Firecrawl dashboard for error details
2. Verify API key has v1 access
3. Try updated payload (already implemented)
4. Debug with test function

**Result:**
- ✅ Real events from website
- ✅ Automatic weekly updates
- ⏱️ Takes 15-30 minutes to debug

### Path C: Direct Web Scraping (LONGER - 30-60 minutes)

**Best for:** No API dependencies, fully custom

**Steps:**
1. I create direct HTTP scraper
2. Parse HTML instead of using Firecrawl
3. More code but no API needed

**Result:**
- ✅ No Firecrawl dependency
- ✅ Free (no API costs)
- ✅ More control
- ⏱️ Takes 30-60 min to build

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Do Path A RIGHT NOW (5 minutes):**

This lets you:
1. ✅ See your app working completely
2. ✅ Test all UI features
3. ✅ Verify weather integration
4. ✅ Build Form1 layout with real data
5. ✅ Show off to friends/users!

**Then fix Firecrawl later** at your leisure.

## 🚀 Immediate Action Items

### To Get App Working in 5 Minutes:

```bash
# 1. Create hourly_weather table in Anvil Data Tables

# 2. Push code
git add server_code/
git commit -m "Add test events and hourly weather"
git push origin main

# 3. In Anvil:
#    - Pull from Git
#    - AdminForm → Click "1. Setup Database"
#    - AdminForm → Visual editor → Add button:
#        name: load_test_events_button
#        text: "Load Test Events"
#        icon: fa:flask
#    - Click "Load Test Events" button

# 4. Result:
#    ✅ 14 events in database
#    ✅ Weather scores calculated
#    ✅ Recommendations ready
#    ✅ App fully testable!
```

### To View Your Data:

```
Data Tables → events
  → Should see 14 events
  → Check recommendation_score (0-100)
  → Check weather_score (0-100)
  → Check categories (AI-assigned)

Data Tables → weather_forecast
  → Should see 3 rows (Fri/Sat/Sun)

Data Tables → hourly_weather
  → Should see ~72 rows (hourly forecasts)
```

## 📈 What's Left

### UI Layout (30-60 minutes)
- Arrange Form1 components in Anvil visual editor
- Connect RepeatingPanels
- Style weather cards
- Test filtering and search

### Firecrawl Fix (15-30 minutes)
- Debug API error
- Or use alternative scraping
- Or stick with test events

### Final Polish (1-2 hours)

- Error messages
- Help text

### Deployment (5 minutes)
- Set Form1 as startup
- Make app public
- Share link!
