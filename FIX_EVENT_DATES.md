# Fix Event Dates - Action Required

## 🐛 What Was Wrong

**Root Cause Identified**: Individual event pages show **ALL future occurrences** of recurring events.

### Example - Broad Ave Art Walk:

**Event page contains**:
- "Saturday, November 1" ✅ (this weekend)
- "Friday, November 7" ❌ (next occurrence)  
- "Friday, November 14" ❌ (future occurrence)

**Old scraper behavior**:
1. Event listed under "FRIDAY" on /weekend page → Assigned Nov 1 (Friday)
2. Scraped event page → Found "Friday, November 07"
3. Overrode date to Nov 7 ❌ WRONG!

**New scraper behavior**:
1. Event listed under "FRIDAY" on /weekend page → Assigned Nov 1 (Friday)
2. Scraped event page for location, time, cost, description ✅
3. **Ignores dates** from event page ✅
4. Keeps Nov 1 (Friday) from /weekend page assignment ✅

## ✅ Fixes Pushed to GitHub

1. **`api_helpers.py`**: Fixed `get_weekend_dates()` to handle Fri-Sun scraping correctly
2. **`scraper_service.py`**: Completely removed date extraction from event pages
3. **Both files**: Added detailed comments explaining the logic

## 🔧 How to Fix Your Current Data

Your database currently has events with **wrong dates** (Nov 7+). Here's how to fix:

### Step 1: Pull Latest Code in Anvil

1. Click **Version History** (clock icon)
2. Click **"Pull from origin"**
3. Wait for sync

### Step 2: Clear Bad Data

In Anvil console, run:

```python
# Clear all events (they have wrong dates)
anvil.server.call('clear_all_data')
```

This will clear:
- ❌ All events (wrong dates)
- ❌ Weather data (might be stale)
- ❌ Scrape logs

### Step 3: Fetch Fresh Data

In Anvil console, run:

```python
# Trigger new scrape with corrected logic
anvil.server.call('trigger_data_refresh')
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to complete.

### Step 4: Verify Dates

After it completes, check the output:

```
Weekend dates (Central Time, Fri): Fri=2025-11-01, Sat=2025-11-02, Sun=2025-11-03
✓ 15 future events to process
```

Should see **Nov 1, 2, 3** not Nov 7!

### Step 5: Refresh App

1. Reload the MainApp in your browser
2. Events should now have **correct dates**
3. Friday past events should be filtered out (it's 11 PM Friday)

## 📊 Expected Results

### What You'll See:

**Weather**: 
- ✅ Friday Nov 1
- ✅ Saturday Nov 2  
- ✅ Sunday Nov 3

**Events**:
- ❌ No Friday Nov 1 events (already past - it's 11 PM Friday)
- ✅ Saturday Nov 2 events
- ✅ Sunday Nov 3 events
- ❌ NO Nov 7+ events

**Event Count**:
- Before: ~86 events (many with wrong dates)
- After: ~10-20 events (only this weekend, only future)

## 🎯 Date Assignment Logic (Fixed)

### When /weekend page is scraped:

**Mon-Thu scraping**:
```
Page shows: "This Weekend" (upcoming)
Friday header → This week's Friday
Saturday header → This week's Saturday
Sunday header → This week's Sunday
```

**Fri scraping** (like your 4 AM run):
```
Page shows: "This Weekend" (current, started yesterday)
Friday header → Today (Nov 1)
Saturday header → Tomorrow (Nov 2)
Sunday header → Day after (Nov 3)
```

**Sat-Sun scraping**:
```
Page shows: "This Weekend" (in progress)
Friday header → Last Friday (already passed)
Saturday header → Today or yesterday
Sunday header → Today or tomorrow
```

### What gets scraped from event pages:

✅ **Used**:
- Location
- Start time
- Cost
- Description

❌ **Ignored**:
- Dates (unreliable for recurring events)

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Many Memphis events are **recurring** (every weekend, every month):
- Broad Ave Art Walk: First Saturday every month
- Music events: Weekly or monthly
- Farmers markets: Weekly

Event pages list ALL future dates. The /weekend page is **curated weekly** to show only THIS weekend's events.

**Trust the curation, not the event page dates!**

## 📝 Verification Checklist

After running `clear_all_data` and `trigger_data_refresh`:

- [ ] Output shows correct weekend dates (Nov 1, 2, 3)
- [ ] No "No weather data for Nov 7" errors
- [ ] Events show Saturday/Sunday (Friday is past)
- [ ] Broad Ave Art Walk shows correct date
- [ ] Event count is reasonable (~10-20, not 86)

## 🚀 Next Run Will Be Perfect

Once you clear and refresh, every future run will:
- ✅ Assign correct dates based on /weekend page headers
- ✅ Filter out past events immediately
- ✅ Only analyze future events (save API credits)
- ✅ Show users only relevant upcoming events

The fix is live on GitHub - just pull, clear, and refresh! 🎉
