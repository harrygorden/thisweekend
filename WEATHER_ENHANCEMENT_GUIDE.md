# 🌤️ Enhanced Weather System with Hourly Forecasts

## What's New

I've upgraded the weather system to use **48-hour hourly forecasts** from OpenWeather for much more accurate event recommendations!

### Key Enhancements

1. **48-Hour Hourly Forecasts** - Get weather for specific event times
2. **New `hourly_weather` Table** - Stores hour-by-hour data separately
3. **Humidity & UV Index** - Additional weather metrics
4. **Precise Time Matching** - Match events to exact hour forecasts
5. **Future: AI Weather Assistant** - Can be added later

## 📊 New Data Table: `hourly_weather`

### Schema (10 columns)

| Column Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | DateTime | Full datetime of forecast |
| `hour_time` | Text | Time string (e.g., "3:00 PM") |
| `date` | Date | Date of forecast |
| `temp` | Number | Temperature (°F) |
| `feels_like` | Number | Feels-like temperature (°F) |
| `conditions` | Text | Weather description |
| `precipitation_chance` | Number | Rain chance (0-100%) |
| `wind_speed` | Number | Wind speed (mph) |
| `humidity` | Number | Humidity percentage |
| `uvi` | Number | UV index |
| `fetched_at` | DateTime | When data was fetched |

### How to Create the Table

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**

The table will be created automatically when you run the setup:

1. In AdminForm, click **"1. Setup Database"**
2. The hourly_weather table will be created automatically
3. All 10 columns will be added

**Option 2: Manual**

1. Go to **Data Tables** tab in Anvil
2. Click **"Add Table"**
3. Name it: `hourly_weather`
4. Run setup to add columns automatically

## 🎯 How It Works

### Before (Daily Forecasts Only)

```
Event: Outdoor Concert, Saturday 7:00 PM
Weather: Saturday - High 75°F, Low 55°F, 30% rain
Score: Based on daily average
```

### After (Hourly Forecasts)

```
Event: Outdoor Concert, Saturday 7:00 PM
Weather: Saturday 7:00 PM - 68°F, feels like 65°F, 15% rain
Score: Based on EXACT hour weather
```

**Result:** Much more accurate recommendations!

## 📈 Data Flow

```
OpenWeather API (48-hour hourly data)
          ↓
extract_weekend_forecasts()
    ↓
    ├→ weather_forecast table (daily summaries, 3 rows)
    └→ hourly_weather table (hourly details, ~72 rows for 3 days)
          ↓
get_weather_for_datetime(event_date, event_time)
    ↓
    ├→ Try hourly_weather table first (precise!)
    └→ Fallback to daily forecast
          ↓
calculate_weather_score()
    ↓
Accurate recommendation!
