# SDK Metadata Bug Fix

## 🐛 Bug Found & Fixed

### The Problem

When running the background task with the Firecrawl Python SDK, you got this error:

```
✅ SDK scrape successful: 28914 characters
❌ SDK error: 'DocumentMetadata' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Root Cause:** The code was treating the SDK's `metadata` object as a **dictionary** when it's actually a **Python object** with attributes.

---

## ✅ The Fix

**File:** `server_code/scraper_service.py`

**Before (WRONG):**
```python
# Treating metadata like a dictionary
metadata = result.metadata
print(f"  Page title: {metadata.get('title', 'Unknown')}")      # ❌ WRONG
print(f"  Status code: {metadata.get('statusCode', 'Unknown')}")  # ❌ WRONG
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```python
# Treating metadata as an object with attributes
metadata = result.metadata
title = getattr(metadata, 'title', 'Unknown')           # ✅ CORRECT
status_code = getattr(metadata, 'statusCode', 'Unknown') # ✅ CORRECT
print(f"  Page title: {title}")
print(f"  Status code: {status_code}")
```

## 📊 What Changed

### Lines 131-137 in `server_code/scraper_service.py`:

```python
# Log metadata if available (metadata is an object, not a dict)
if hasattr(result, 'metadata') and result.metadata:
    metadata = result.metadata
    # Access metadata attributes directly (not dictionary keys)
    title = getattr(metadata, 'title', 'Unknown')
    status_code = getattr(metadata, 'statusCode', getattr(metadata, 'status_code', 'Unknown'))
    print(f"  Page title: {title}")
    print(f"  Status code: {status_code}")
```

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Use `getattr()` instead of `.get()`
- ✅ Handle both `statusCode` and `status_code` (in case SDK uses different naming)
- ✅ Safer attribute access with fallback values

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

Now when you run the background task, you should see:

```
✅ Firecrawl Python SDK available - using SDK mode
Scraping events from https://ilovememphisblog.com/weekend...
  Trying Firecrawl API...
  🚀 Using Firecrawl Python SDK (recommended)
  Scraping https://ilovememphisblog.com/weekend...
  ✅ SDK scrape successful: 28914 characters
  Page title: This Weekend in Memphis       ← ✅ Should work now!
  Status code: 200                          ← ✅ Should work now!

```

**No more SDK errors!** 🎉

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The Firecrawl Python SDK returns a **`Document` object** that looks like this:

```python
class Document:
    markdown: str
    html: str
    metadata: DocumentMetadata  # ← This is an OBJECT, not a dict!
    links: List[str]
```

The `metadata` property is a **`DocumentMetadata` object** with attributes like:
- `metadata.title`
- `metadata.statusCode`
- `metadata.description`
- `metadata.sourceURL`

**Not a dictionary!** So you can't use `.get()` on it.

## 📝 How to Access SDK Objects

### Dictionary vs Object

```python
# Dictionary (use .get())
my_dict = {"title": "Hello", "status": 200}
title = my_dict.get("title", "Unknown")  # ✅ Works for dicts

# Object (use getattr() or direct access)
class MyObject:
    title = "Hello"
    status = 200

my_obj = MyObject()
title = getattr(my_obj, "title", "Unknown")  # ✅ Works for objects
# OR
title = my_obj.title if hasattr(my_obj, "title") else "Unknown"
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Fix

Run your background task again in Anvil:

```python
anvil.server.call('run_data_refresh')
```

**Expected:** No more SDK errors! The scrape should complete successfully.

---

### 2. About the HTTP Fallback Errors

You also saw these errors in your output:

```
⚠️ Firecrawl API failed with error: 'URL must have a valid top-level domain'
```

**This is from the HTTP fallback**, not the SDK. Now that the SDK is fixed, you won't even hit the HTTP fallback!

**Why the HTTP error occurred:**
- Firecrawl's API validation might be stricter for certain endpoints
- The HTTP method might need different parameters
- **BUT: This doesn't matter anymore since the SDK works!**

---

### 3. Monitoring

Check your console output for:

✅ **Good signs:**
```
✅ Firecrawl Python SDK available - using SDK mode
🚀 Using Firecrawl Python SDK (recommended)
✅ SDK scrape successful: [X] characters
Page title: [actual title]
Status code: 200
```

❌ **Bad signs (shouldn't happen now):**
```
❌ SDK error: 'DocumentMetadata' object has no attribute 'get'
🔄 Falling back to raw HTTP method...
```

## 📦 Git Backup

**Commit:** `13b33f0`
**Message:** "Fix SDK metadata access bug - use getattr() instead of .get() for Document object attributes"

**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub

## 💡 Lesson Learned

**When using Python SDKs:**
1. ✅ Check the SDK documentation for response types
2. ✅ Use `getattr()` for safe attribute access on objects
3. ✅ Don't assume everything is a dictionary
4. ✅ Use type hints if available (they help catch these issues!)

**SDK Response Types:**
- Firecrawl SDK: Returns `Document` objects
- OpenAI SDK: Returns response objects (not dicts)
- Always check: `type(result)` when debugging

## 🎉 Summary

**Problem:** SDK was working but crashed on metadata access  
**Cause:** Using dictionary methods on an object  
**Fix:** Use `getattr()` instead of `.get()`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and pushed to GitHub  
**Next:** Test your background task - should work perfectly now!

---

**The SDK successfully scraped 28,914 characters - it was SO close to working!** 🚀

Now it should work flawlessly! 🎯
