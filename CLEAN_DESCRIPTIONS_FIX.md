# Clean Event Descriptions Fix

## 🐛 The Problem

Event descriptions were filled with navigation markdown:

```
Description: "[Skip to content](https://ilovememphisblog.com/events/arts/notebook#main) 
[Calendar](https://ilovememphisblog.com/events/category/all-events) 
[Visit Website](https://www.orpheum-memphis.com/events/the-notebook-the-musical) 
[Get Tickets](https://www.ticketmaster.com/...)

Based on the best-selling novel..."
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Navigation links included
- ❌ Image markdown included
- ❌ Markdown link syntax in description
- ❌ Hard to read
- ❌ Not useful for users

---

## ✅ The Solution

**Improved `extract_details_from_event_page()` to:**

### 1. **Skip Navigation Links**
```python
nav_skip_patterns = [
    r'skip to content',
    r'^\[calendar\]',
    r'^\[visit website\]',
    r'^\[get tickets\]',
    r'^\[share\]',
    r'^\[tweet\]',
    r'^!\[',  # Image markdown
]
```

### 2. **Skip Standalone Links**
```python
# Skip short standalone markdown links (navigation)
if re.match(r'^\[.+\]\(.+\)$', line) and len(line) < 100:
    continue  # Skip
```

### 3. **Clean Markdown Syntax**
```python
# Remove markdown link syntax, keep just text
clean_line = re.sub(r'\[([^\]]+)\]\([^\)]+\)', r'\1', line)
```

**Example:**
```
Before: "[Visit the venue](https://example.com)"
After:  "Visit the venue"
```

### 4. **Extract Only Substantial Text**
```python
# Only collect lines that are:
- After the main heading
- Not metadata (no ** fields)
- Not mostly links (< 2 links per line)
- Substantial (> 30 chars)
- Not images (no !)
```

### 5. **Limit Description Length**
```python
# First 3 substantial lines, max 500 chars
details['description'] = ' '.join(description_lines[:3])
if len(details['description']) > 500:
    details['description'] = details['description'][:500] + '...'
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Example: "The Notebook: The Musical"

#### Before (Messy):
```
Description: "[Skip to content](https://ilovememphisblog.com/events/arts/notebook#main) [Calendar](https://ilovememphisblog.com/events/category/all-events) [Visit Website](https://www.orpheum-memphis.com/events/the-notebook-the-musical) [Get Tickets](https://www.ticketmaster.com/the-orpheum-theatre-memphis-tickets-memphis/venue/221389?startDate=2025-10-28&endDate=2025-11-02) ![](https://ilovememphisblog.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_event_full/public/event-main_images/event-upload--NOTE25_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=HwQjHGzy) Based on the best-selling novel that inspired the iconic film, _THE NOTEBOOK_ tells the story of Allie and Noah..."
```

**Problems:**
- 5 navigation links at start
- 1 image markdown
- Hard to read
- Markdown syntax everywhere

---

#### After (Clean):
```
Description: "Based on the best-selling novel that inspired the iconic film, THE NOTEBOOK tells the story of Allie and Noah, both from different worlds, who share a lifetime of love despite the forces that threaten to pull them apart. Full of butterfly-inducing highs and beautiful songs, THE NOTEBOOK is a deeply moving portrait of the enduring power of love."
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ No navigation links
- ✅ No images
- ✅ No markdown syntax
- ✅ Clean, readable text
- ✅ Actual event description!

## 📝 What's Extracted

### From Event Page Structure:

**Event pages have this format:**
```markdown
[Skip to content](#main)
[Calendar](/events/category/all-events)
[Visit Website](https://venue.com)
[Get Tickets](https://ticketmaster.com)

![Event image](image_url)

# Event Title

**Location**: Specific Venue
**Time**: 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM
**Cost**: $50-$100
**Date**: Friday, November 1, 2025

Description paragraph 1 with details about the event.

Description paragraph 2 with more information.

Description paragraph 3 with even more details.
```

**We now extract:**
- **Location**: "Specific Venue" (cleaned)
- **Time**: "7:00 PM"
- **Cost**: "$50-$100" (cleaned)
- **Description**: "Description paragraph 1... paragraph 2... paragraph 3..."
  - NO navigation links
  - NO images
  - NO markdown syntax
  - Just clean text!

---

## 🎯 Extraction Rules

### What Gets Skipped:

1. **Navigation at top:**
   - `[Skip to content](...)`
   - `[Calendar](...)`
   - `[Visit Website](...)`
   - `[Get Tickets](...)`
   - `[Share](...)`

2. **Images:**
   - `![Image alt text](image_url)`

3. **Short standalone links:**
   - Any `[text](url)` under 100 chars on its own line

4. **Metadata fields:**
   - Lines starting with `**` (these are extracted separately)

5. **Lines with many links:**
   - Lines with > 2 markdown links (likely navigation)

### What Gets Kept:

1. **Structured fields:**
   - `**Location**: ...` → extracted to location field
   - `**Time**: ...` → extracted to start_time field
   - `**Cost**: ...` → extracted to cost_raw field
   - `**Date**: ...` → extracted to date field

2. **Description text:**
   - Substantial paragraphs (> 30 chars)
   - After the main heading
   - Without markdown link syntax
   - First 3 paragraphs, max 500 chars

## 📈 Data Quality Improvement

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Description** | Navigation + image + text | Clean text only ✅ |
| **Location** | May have `[Link](url)` | Clean text ✅ |
| **Cost** | May have `[Link](url)` | Clean text ✅ |
| **Readability** | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent |
| **User-friendly** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File: `server_code/scraper_service.py`

**Function: `extract_details_from_event_page()`**

**Changes:**
1. Added navigation skip patterns (Skip to content, Calendar, Visit Website, etc.)
2. Skip standalone markdown links under 100 chars
3. Remove markdown link syntax from extracted fields: `[text](url)` → `text`
4. Track "in_description_section" to know when to start collecting description
5. Skip lines with > 2 links (likely navigation rows)
6. Skip lines with images (`![...](...)`)
7. Clean markdown from description text
8. Limit to first 3 substantial paragraphs, max 500 chars

**Function: `parse_event_link_text()`**

**Changes:**
- Only use event page description if substantial (> 20 chars)
- Fallback to link text if event page description is too short or empty

2. Skip: [Calendar]              ← Navigation
3. Skip: [Visit Website]         ← Navigation
4. Skip: ![Image]                ← Image
5. Skip: # Event Title           ← Heading (marks start)
6. Extract: **Location**: Memphis Zoo → location = "Memphis Zoo"
7. Extract: **Time**: 10 AM - 5 PM → start_time = "10 AM"
8. Extract: **Cost**: $15/adult... → cost_raw = "$15/adult, $10/child"
9. Collect: "Join us for a fun day..."  ← Description paragraph 1
10. Collect: "Activities include..."   ← Description paragraph 2
11. Collect: "Don't forget..."          ← Description paragraph 3

Output:
---
{
  'location': 'Memphis Zoo',
  'start_time': '10 AM',
  'cost_raw': '$15/adult, $10/child',
  'description': 'Join us for a fun day at the zoo with special activities! Activities include animal encounters, face painting, and more. Don\'t forget to visit the gift shop!'
}
