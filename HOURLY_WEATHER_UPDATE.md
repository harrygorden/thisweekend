# Hourly Weather Update - Technical Documentation

**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Impact:** Weather scoring, recommendations, and AI suggestions

---

## Overview

This update enables the application to utilize **event-specific hourly weather forecasts** instead of relying solely on daily forecasts. This provides much more accurate weather-aware recommendations by matching each event's start time with the precise weather conditions expected at that hour.

## Problem Statement

### Before This Update

The system was:
- ✅ Fetching hourly weather data from OpenWeather API (48 hours)
- ✅ Storing hourly data in the database
- ❌ **NOT using hourly data** for scoring or recommendations
- ❌ Using daily high/low temps for ALL events regardless of time
- ❌ Passing only daily summaries to AI for suggestions

### Example of the Problem

```
Event: "Sunset Yoga at Overton Park" 
Time: 7:00 PM on Saturday
Day Forecast: High 85°F, Low 62°F, 30% rain

OLD BEHAVIOR:
- Weather score based on 85°F (hot, but accurate for 3 PM, not 7 PM)
- AI suggestion: "It'll be warm at 85°F"
- Reality at 7 PM: Actually 68°F and perfect!

NEW BEHAVIOR:
- Weather score based on 68°F at 7:00 PM (accurate!)
- AI suggestion: "Perfect at 7 PM with temps around 68°F"
- Reality: Exactly right!
```

## What Changed

### 1. Weather Scoring (`weather_service.py`)

#### New Helper Function: `get_best_weather_values()`

```python
def get_best_weather_values(weather_data):
    """
    Extract the best available weather values from weather_data.
    Prioritizes hourly data when available, falls back to daily forecast.
    """
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "temp": 68,                    # Actual temp at event time
    "feels_like": 65,              # Feels-like temp at event time
    "precipitation_chance": 20,    # Rain chance at event time
    "wind_speed": 8,               # Wind at event time
    "conditions": "partly cloudy", # Conditions at event time
    "humidity": 55,                # Humidity at event time
    "is_hourly": True              # True if using hourly data
}
```

#### Updated: `calculate_weather_score()`

**Before:**
```python
# Always used daily temp_high
temp = weather_data.get("temp_high", 70)
```

**After:**
```python
# Uses hourly data when available
weather_values = get_best_weather_values(weather_data)
effective_temp = weather_values["feels_like"]  # Event-time feels-like temp
```

**Impact:**
- 🎯 Scores now reflect **actual conditions at event time**
- 🌡️ Uses **feels-like temperature** for more accurate comfort assessment
- ⏰ **7 PM outdoor event** no longer penalized for 3 PM heat

### 2. Weather Warnings (`data_processor.py`)

#### Updated: `get_weather_warning()`

**Before:**
```python
temp = weather_data.get("temp_high", 70)  # Daily high
warnings.append(f"Very hot ({temp}°F)")
```

**After:**
```python
weather_values = weather_service.get_best_weather_values(weather_data)
feels_like = weather_values["feels_like"]  # Hourly feels-like
if is_hourly and feels_like != temp:
    warnings.append(f"Very hot (feels like {feels_like}°F)")
```

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ Warnings now reflect **actual event-time conditions**
- 🌡️ Shows **"feels like"** temperature when different from actual
- ⏰ No false warnings for events scheduled during cooler hours

### 3. AI Suggestions (`ai_service.py`)

#### Updated: `build_suggestions_prompt()`

**Before:**
```python
# Only passed daily summary to AI
event_details.append(
    f"- {title} ({venue}, {day}, {cost})"
)
```

**After:**
```python
# Fetches and includes event-time specific weather
event_weather = weather_service.get_weather_for_datetime(
    event['date'],
    event['start_time']
)

if event_weather and event_weather.get('hourly'):
    h = event_weather['hourly']
    weather_context = f" [Weather at {time}: {h['temp']}°F, {h['conditions']}, {h['precipitation_chance']}% rain]"

event_details.append(
    f"- {title} ({venue}, {day} at {time}, {cost}){weather_context}"
)
```

**Prompt Enhancement:**
```
Available Events (with event-specific weather conditions):
- Sunset Yoga (outdoor, Saturday at 7:00 PM, Free) [Weather at 7:00 PM: 68°F, partly cloudy, 10% rain]
- Farmers Market (outdoor, Saturday at 9:00 AM, Free) [Weather at 9:00 AM: 72°F, sunny, 5% rain]
- Jazz Concert (outdoor, Saturday at 3:00 PM, $$) [Weather at 3:00 PM: 85°F, sunny, 20% rain]
```

**AI Instructions Updated:**
```
- Use the event-specific weather conditions shown in brackets [...]
- Match outdoor events with good weather at their specific time
- Consider "feels like" temperature at the exact event time
- Explain WHY each event is perfect for its specific time
```

**Impact:**
- 🤖 **GPT-4.1** now has precise weather for each event time
- 📝 Suggestions reference **actual event-time conditions**
- 🎯 Recommendations based on **when events happen**, not daily averages

## Example Scenario

### Saturday Events & Weather

**Daily Forecast:** High 88°F, Low 65°F, 25% rain

**Hourly Breakdown:**
| Time | Temp | Feels Like | Rain % | Conditions |
|------|------|------------|--------|------------|
| 9 AM | 70°F | 68°F | 5% | Sunny |
| 12 PM | 82°F | 85°F | 10% | Partly Cloudy |
| 3 PM | 88°F | 92°F | 25% | Partly Cloudy |
| 6 PM | 78°F | 78°F | 15% | Partly Cloudy |
| 9 PM | 68°F | 66°F | 5% | Clear |

### Event Recommendations

#### Event 1: Morning Farmers Market (9 AM)
**OLD:** Score: 70 (penalized for day's 88°F high)  
**NEW:** Score: 95 (perfect 68°F morning conditions!)

#### Event 2: Afternoon Food Truck Rally (3 PM)
**OLD:** Score: 70 (uses same 88°F as above)  
**NEW:** Score: 60 (correctly flagged - feels like 92°F!)

#### Event 3: Evening Concert (9 PM)
**OLD:** Score: 70 (penalized for 88°F high)  
**NEW:** Score: 98 (perfect 66°F evening!)

### AI Suggestion Output

**OLD (Generic):**
> "Saturday looks warm with highs around 88°F. Check out the Farmers Market if you want outdoor activities. The Evening Concert is also a good option."

**NEW (Event-Specific):**
> "Perfect morning for the Farmers Market at 9 AM - it'll be a comfortable 68°F with sunny skies. The Evening Concert at 9 PM is ideal too, cooling down to 66°F with clear conditions. I'd skip the Food Truck Rally at 3 PM though - it'll feel like 92°F at that time!"

- ✅ **No additional API calls**

### Database Queries
- ✅ **No change** - hourly data already stored
- ✅ **Same query count**

### Processing Time
- ⏱️ **Negligible impact** - simple dict lookups
- 📊 **~0.1ms per event** for hourly data extraction

### AI Token Usage
- 📈 **Slight increase** - more detailed prompts
- 📊 **~100-150 additional tokens** per suggestion
- 💰 **Cost impact:** ~$0.02 more per week (negligible)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Verify morning events (9 AM) get appropriate morning temps
- [ ] Verify afternoon events (3 PM) get appropriate afternoon temps
- [ ] Verify evening events (7 PM+) get appropriate evening temps
- [ ] Check weather warnings show event-time specific conditions
- [ ] Confirm AI suggestions reference event-time weather
- [ ] Test fallback when hourly data unavailable
- [ ] Verify "feels like" appears in warnings when different from temp

### Automated Verification

```python
# Test event-time matching
event = {
    'date': saturday,
    'start_time': '7:00 PM'
}
weather = weather_service.get_weather_for_datetime(
    event['date'],
    event['start_time']
)

assert weather['hourly']['time'] == '7:00 PM'
assert weather['hourly']['temp'] != weather['temp_high']  # Should differ!
```
